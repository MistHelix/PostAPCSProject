# Grapher 

**Stage 1:**  Proposal

The goal of this project is to be able to insert an equation and generate an image of a graph on a graph that goes from -10 to 10. On top of this when you click on the screen it should display the cordinates of where you clicked. 

For the file structure it would propably be `graph`, `equation`, `point` classes. With `graph` being the class that generates points. `equation` would intake the equation and generate a large amounts of points along the interval so the graph can draw tiny lines conecting all the points. Finally `point` would be used to generate the point when clicked and to store the outputs from `equation`.

This project would teach people how to open visuals along with drawing visuals. Along with giving people more practice in arrays of objects.

For dividing labor it could very simply be split into having one per section. Though graph probably would require two people to work on being able to open an image create a graph and then create the graph.
